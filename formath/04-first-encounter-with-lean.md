# A first encounter with Lean 4

There is no better way to learn how to formalize mathematics than to jump head-first into it. At first using a proof assistant may feel complicated and a bit overwhelming. Luckily, Lean 4 has very good learning resources that we shall rely on.

In class we will look at [`GlimpseOfLean``](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/GlimpseOfLean) by Patrick Massot, an introduction that takes about 2 to 3 hours to complete. A more thorough and slow-paced learning resource is [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/) by the same author.

## Homework

There is a saying in Slovene, “Vaja dela mojstra” (exercise makes a master), with the side-condition “če mojster dela vajo” (if the master does exercises). It applies perfectly to learning formalized mathematics – there is no other way but to do it. Thus, your task for the week is as follows:

* Complete the exercises in [`GlimpseOfLean``](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/GlimpseOfLean), and at least one extra topic.
* Read a good chunk of [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/). It is highly recommended that you familiarize yourself with chapters 1, 2, 3 and 4.
