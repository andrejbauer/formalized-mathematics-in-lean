# Organizational features

Lean helps organize formalized mathematics in several ways. In this lecture we shall look at three mechanisms:

* [sections](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/sections.html)
* [namespaces](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/namespaces.html)
* [implicit arguments](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/implicit.html) and [strict implicit arguments](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/interacting_with_lean.html#more-on-implicit-arguments)

## Formalization styles

In the remaining time we will practice different formalization styles, from directly writing proof terms to using varying amounts of tactics.

## Reading material

* [Lean 4 manual – Organizational features](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/organization.html)

## Homework

* Continue going through [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/), and make sure you solve exercises!
* Browse [Mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/) (the `Mathlib` section) too see what is already there.
* Think about what you would like to formalize for your class project. It should be a topic that you are familiar with, and it should have several good goal posts, so that if you do not reach the end you will still have accomplished something.
