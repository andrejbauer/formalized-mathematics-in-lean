# Structures and type classes

In this lecture we shall learn about structures and type classes. These are used to build hierarchies of mathematical structures.

We shall again draw from [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/index.html), which covers these topics in
“[Chapter 6 - Structures](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/C06_Structures.html)” and
“[Chapter 7 – Hierarchies](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/C07_Hierarchies.html)”.

## Reading material

[Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/index.html):

* [Chapter 6 – Structures](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/C06_Structures.html)
* [Chapter 7 – Hierarchies](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/C07_Hierarchies.html)

## Homework

* Read the above reading material and solve the exercises.
* Talk to the lecturer about your class project, either on Discord, or by email, or by setting up an appointment.
