# Type theory

The working mathematician is familiar with the set-theoretic foundation of mathematics. However, Lean and many other proof assistants use a different formalism known as **type theory**. This is because type theory is quite close to how mathematics is *actually* done, and because type theory can be used simultaneously as a programming language and a foundation of mathematics.

In this lecture we shall review the basics of type theory, starting from the idea that we are "just reformulating" set theory. While this gives a coherent view of what type theory is about (namely sets), one should keep in mind that it is not the only possible coherent view. A notable alternative is the view of types as "spaces up to homotopy equivalence", an intuition captured by [homotopy type theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org).

While traditional axiomatizations of set theory, for instance the [Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory), are based on first-order logic and describe sets in terms of existence axioms, type theory is closer to how algebra operates, namely by postulating *operations* and *equations*.
