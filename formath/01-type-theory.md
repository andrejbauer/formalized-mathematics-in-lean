# Type theory

## Outline

The working mathematician is familiar with the set-theoretic foundation of mathematics. However, Lean and many other proof assistants use a different formalism known as **type theory**. This is because type theory is quite close to how mathematics is *actually* done, and because type theory can be used simultaneously as a programming language and a foundation of mathematics.

In this lecture we shall review the basics of type theory, starting from the idea that we are "just reformulating" set theory. While this gives a coherent view of what type theory is about (namely sets), one should keep in mind that it is not the only possible coherent view. A notable alternative is [homotopy type theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org).

Traditional axiomatizations of set theory, for instance the [Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory), are based on first-order logic and describe sets in terms of existence axioms. Type theory is closer to algebra, because it describes what sets are in terms of **constructions**, **operations** and **equations**.

## Reading material

At this point you should read the following material:

* Egbert Rijke, [Introduction to homotopy type theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11082), Chapters 1–4

If you would like to see how the "real-world" type theory of Lean is defined, have a look at:
