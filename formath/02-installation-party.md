# Lean installation party

This is not going to be a regular lecture, but rather an online gathering whose purpose is to make sure that all course participants have successfully installed the software needed for the course.

## Quick instructions

Go ahead with installation of

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* [Lean 4](https://www.lean-lang.org)

You may follow [these instructions](https://docs.lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html).

You will also need to work with `git`. It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with [GitHub](https://github.com), possibly by following these [getting started with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) instructions.

## Slow instructions

If you need more detailed instructions than what is available at the link above, then the best thing is to get help of a human, either one sitting next to you or online. Thus, we are going to organize an installation party where everyone will get interactive help with installation. The date and time will be determined in the classroom.
