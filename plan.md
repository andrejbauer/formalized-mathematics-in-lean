* coercions
* type classes
* notations
* using tactics
* mathlib project
* style guides
* how to contribute
* finding things in Mathlib
* rewriting and simplification
* writing papers and formalized code

## Chapters

## An installation party

* Installing Lean 4 and Visual Studio Code
* git primer
* `elan` and `lake`
* online resources
* the numbers game
* first examples

## A first encounter with type theory

* from sets to types
* families
* `Π`, `Σ`, `ℕ`
* identity type
* universes
* Logic and `Prop`
* the difference between `A : Prop`, `A = True` and `p : A`

Examples: arithmetic, primes, factorization

## Invisible mathematics

Running example: ?

* elaboration
* looking under the hood: inference, unification, equality checking
* coercions, implicit arguments and type classes, informally
* explicit and abstract existence

## Logic and finite sets

* propositional logic
* quantifiers
* basic facts about finite sets


## Structures

* property and structure
* structures
* universes in Lean 4
* theorems, definitions, lemmas
* functions, `match`, termination

* introduce some tactics here

## Inductive types & induction

* inductive types
* identity type
* recursion and termination
* well-founded induction

## Programming in type theory

* computable vs. non-computable
* monads

## Formalization I: something involving type classes

* blueprints
* group theory
* groups
* subgroups are not groups
* isomorphism theorems
* group theory in mathlib

## Formalization II: something involving custom tactics

* should use mathlib

## Formalization III: something involving meta-programming

* macros
* meta-programming


## Contributing to mathlib

* mathlib
